  abstract = {What is a pipeline, and why do we need one for interactive graphics? This conceptual paper attempts to answer these questions, building on previous work. A pipeline controls the transformation from data to graphical objects on our screens, and we argue that the pipeline must be present, in some form, in all graphics software. The pipeline is made explicit in descendants of DataViewer.},
