## What is GDA?
* Used for (p.xi)
    + data cleaning
    + exploring data structure
    + detecting outliers and unusual groups
    + identifying trends and clusters
    + spotting local patterns
    + evaluating modelling output 
    + presenting results (this a bit different to above?)
* Many graphics should be drawn (even when presenting). Difficult if not impossible to summarise with just one graphic. GDA is open-ended and you *pursue multiple ideas in parallel* (p.5)
* GDA and statistical analysis complement each other. Results found graphically should be supported by statistical analysis, and vice versa.
    + Graphics often *casually* used, seems more decorative than informative and *for reasons of routine* rather than communication (p.3)
    + Often possible to find a graphic to support results of a statistical test but not so the other way around (not always able to find a stats analysis to support something you discover graphically) (p.5)
    + Draw many graphs when involved GDA but need to choose wisely which to keep and then finally present.
    
## Possible datasets to explore further w interaction
* UC Berkley dataset (p.9)
    + 3 categorical vars, add Shiny slider to display arrangements for a mosaic plot (reveal levels)

## Graphics for exploring datasets vs presenting results?
