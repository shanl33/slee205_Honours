Strengths and Weaknesses of Graphics Tools
* Consider ease of learning, installing and coverage of desired techniques.

Plotly and Shiny:
- Cannot apply same interaction techniques to large data sets: compare Brush_tableMtcars and Brush_tableFlights.

Shiny: http://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/latest/
 + Easy to learn and set up.
 + Aesthetically appealing output (publish-ready).
 - Limitation on interaction options (?) since only a limited number of input and output options.
 ? Doesn’t allow for low-level control, customisation
 ? Loading large data files onto the R server
 ? Brushing interaction possible (see link above)

R Base Graphics
 - Possible, but difficult to locate interaction (ie. click location).
 - Relatively slow at drawing graphics compared to a browser platform.

Plotly: https://plot.ly/r/reference/
 * ‘Interaction’ functions: plot_ly() or ggplotly().
 + Easy to use with ggplot2 (and automatically loads ggplot2).
   + With ggplot2 brings the flexibility of creating a wide range of plots.
 + Aesthetically appealing output (publish-ready).
 + Allows for collaboration in plot creation.
 + Can be used with Shiny.
 - When data points > 50 000 (eg. AQ delay data):
    - Delay in creating ‘zoom in’ selection of plot.
    - Difficulty keeping up with tooltip display.
    - Lasso/click drag selection very slow and hard to control, difficult to use for exploration.
 - Tooltip default for comparing values can only compare a maximum of 4 obs.
 + Allows for brushing (by lasso) and hence most likely linking.
 ? Can only ‘call up’ variables used in the aesthetics of the plot (?), but combined with Shiny might be able to select the vars to use in aesthetics as inputs.
 ? How to access ggplot() + geom_mosaic():

Plotly and Shiny:  https://plot.ly/r/shinyapp-linked-click/#shiny-app
 + Linking two Plotly graphs is possible.
 - Link must be via a variable that is common in both graphs.
 - Linked plots can only use variables that were in previous plots or called on by Shiny inputs (unable to use a diff var for colour in output plot of Brush_input).
 
Highcharts (via highchartr and htmlwidgets)
 + Purely Javascript, so easy to embed in web pages.

“On-plot” vs “off-plot” interactions
 * Shiny makes “off-plot” interactions easy (was there anything prior to Shiny?).
 * “Traditionally” interaction has been more focused on “on-plot” interactions (see tools described by Cook and Swayne).
 * Plotly allows for “on-plot” interactions, but limited in flexibility of linking different variables. Considerable delay for n>50000. 
 * Smooth “on-plot” interaction is hard to achieve.

* ggobi may set the benchmark of interactive techniques possible and help identify gaps.
