Fostering Undergraduate Data Science
* Project based, focus on large ds, interdisciplinary. Students given videos and code (flipped classroom). Specific learning targets and open-ended data exploration. One-to-one, hands on interaction during lectures. No pre-req assumed.
* Projects: approx 2 weeks in length, groups of 3 students.
* Start with data sets rather than “introducing a tool without motivation”. Motivation to solve a certain problem with the data set.
* Established skills in extracting, querying, wrangling large ds, laying the foundations for further work with large ds. Mentions visualisation in some parts.

Plotly
https://cpsievert.github.io/plotly_book/
 + plotly objects can have more than aes mapping data attached to them, such as statistical output that was generated in R when creating the plot (eg. with goem_smooth())  
  
 - BUT cannot re-execute statistical procedures in response to user event since can’t talk back to R (currently loses the inverse function required to get from the graphic back to the data object when the results are pushed to a web browser). (plotly+shiny) can resolve this, but not (plotly+crosstalk).

 + plot_ly() interacts more directly with plotly.js and hence generally not as ‘expensive’ as ggploty(). Maybe faster with large ds? Theoretically should be but hard to distinguish if using plotly+crosstalk. See runtime.R comparisons and compare 
Brush_Large files.

 - ggplotly() translates each layer of ggplot2 into one or more plotly.js traces. Assumptions about trace attributes not always appropriate, can modify. See: https://cpsievert.github.io/plotly_book/extending-ggplotly.html (Extending ggplotly).

* Linking requires either (plotly+shiny) or (plotly+crosstalk)
 - (plotly+shiny) re-draws whole plot after selection, inefficient if large ds or many graphical elements. eg. For brushed linking of scatterplots (plotly+shiny) re-draws full plot and the layer for the selected points. While (plotly+crosstalk) changes the colour attributes of the selected points (or dimming unselected). (Possibly only leaflet R package doesn’t redraw).
 - Large ds interaction (plotly+crosstalk) feels even slower than (plotly+shiny). Slowed down by crosstalk (?) which is self-claimed to be inappropriate for large DS. Compare Brush_Large (50 000 points). BUT (plotly+crosstalk) can brush both ways.

 - (plotly+crosstalk) cannot use for aggregate values (eg. cannot ‘dim’ unselected values in a box plot), but with (plotly+shiny) can re-draw with selected points.

 + Persistent brushing: pipe plotly object to a ‘highlight()’ layer with ‘persistent=F/T’ and ‘dynamic=F/T’ arguments. Limitations to ‘memorising selections’ and currently a limited number of modes to choose from (cannot support AND), rewinding selections? (see Hofmann and Theus (1998)

Crosstalk
+ Link views between two independent graphing systems (eg. plotly and leaflet maps)

Shiny
 - brushedPoints() seems to use a mapping from the pixels in a raster image to observation numbers in the data frame to link the brushing (based on Yu Han’s experience).  This will be ineffective (impossible?) for large data sets due to over-plotting. Seems inefficient compared to interacting ‘directly’ with a SVG.

Crosstalk
https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/using.html
Crosstalk and Shiny and Plotly (if using Crosstalk w ggplot2 need Shiny, since not html widget)
https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/jcheng/shiny-crosstalk/
 + Achieves similar linked brushing as Plotly by creating a common data set automatically (via ShareData) rather than the user having to manually subset (as with Plotly).  
 + Much easier to link plots ‘both ways’. Also possible in Plotly but requires more code. Crosstalk seems to be created specifically for linked brushing, while Plotly more generally for identification (that can then be manipulated for linked brushing).
 - No equivalent “plotly_click” type of interaction.  Not necessary for scatterplots since can brush just one point, but this may limit Crosstalk interactions (e.g. not possible to create the Plotly correlation heat map type of interaction, https://plot.ly/r/shinyapp-linked-click/).
 + Has its only ‘Shiny-like’ filter inputs that can work in static HTML documents (eg. can use with R markdown)
 - Not appropriate for large data sets (see link).  (ShareData creates a copy of ds to use for interaction, so may be expensive?)
 - Has the potential to connect with html widgets of your own choice, but currently has specific requirements in terms of which htmlwidgets Crosstalk is appropriate for.
 - Currently not possible to select and link plots showing aggregate data (can we do this with Plotly? See: points under Plotly and Shiny).  Brushing or “click selecting” on plots using bins would be useful for large ds, since difficult to brush with over plotting.

Plotly and Shiny
 - Brush and link does not work for large data sets. Not all members of the brushed subset are plotted on the linked plot.  Number of obs plotted seems fewer than those showing in the R output for the subset.  See: Brush_Link_large.R 
 - For geom_hexbin: ‘plotly_selected’ doesn’t work, returns ‘list()’ for event.
 - For geom_hexbin: ‘plotly_click’ records ‘curveNumber'=rank of frequency (ie. all bins with count=1 has curveNumber=0). This could not be used as to group data as it may be possible with using plotly_click with a histogram (see below).
# All the bins with frequency = 1 has curveNumber=0.
# The highest frequency (count=11302) bin has curveNumber=75.
 which refeand “plotly_selected” not possible (NULL subset).
 + geom_histogram() will be possible to select but will need to group ds in bins. Compare Brush_histogram.R and Brush_bar.R (works fine).
 - ‘plotly_hover’ and ‘plotly_relayout’ do not provide meaningful interactions. (Output for plotly_relayout is x and y window dimensions of zoom).

Large ds
* Current interaction tools can help when there is a large number of variables, through filtering inputs, but when there is a large number of observations, problems with over plotting and time taken to create plots, get in the way of using these tools for meaningful interactions.

General comments
? Painting might be possible with crosstalk() See:https://rpubs.com/cpsievert/206878
? Which allows for more flexible interaction or manipulation? Crosstalk uses ShareData to create an ‘environment’ while Plotly uses event_data() to capture default “identifiers” in a list. The Methods in the documentation of ShareData suggests it captures more info than event_data().
+ Interactive tools that build off base plots and/or ggplot2 are easier because don’t need to recode when moving between static and interactive environment. Also easier to focus on learning the interactive part (rather than trouble shooting plotting too).

Strengths and Weaknesses of Graphics Tools
* Consider ease of learning, installing and coverage of desired techniques.  
See summaryTable.csv.

Shiny: 
http://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/latest/
 + Easy to learn and set up.
 + Aesthetically appealing output (publish-ready).
 - Limitation on interaction options (?) since only a limited number of input and output options.
 + Good for off-plot interactions (but on-plot?)
 ? Loading large data files onto the R server

R Base Graphics
 - Possible, but difficult to locate interaction (ie. click location).
 - Relatively slow at drawing graphics compared to a browser platform.

Plotly: 
https://plot.ly/r/reference/
 * ‘Interaction’ functions: plot_ly() or ggplotly().
 + Easy to use with ggplot2 (and automatically loads ggplot2).
   + With ggplot2 brings the flexibility of creating a wide range of plots.
 + Aesthetically appealing output (publish-ready).
 + Allows for collaboration in plot creation.
 + Can be used with Shiny.
 - When data points > 50 000 (eg. AQ delay data):
    - Delay in creating ‘zoom in’ selection of plot.
    - Difficulty keeping up with tooltip display.
    - Lasso/click drag selection very slow and hard to control, difficult to use for exploration.
 - Tooltip default for comparing values can only compare a maximum of 4 obs.
 + Allows for brushing (by lasso) and hence most likely linking.
 ? Can only ‘call up’ variables used in the aesthetics of the plot (?), but combined with Shiny might be able to select the vars to use in aesthetics as inputs.
 ? How to access ggplot() + geom_mosaic():  
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggmosaic/vignettes/ggmosaic.html

Plotly and Shiny:  
https://plot.ly/r/shiny-gallery/
 + Linking two Plotly graphs is possible.
 - Link must be via a variable that is common in both graphs.
 - Linked plots can only use variables that were in previous plots or called on by Shiny inputs (unable to use a diff var for colour in output plot of Brush_input).
 
Highcharts (via highchartr and htmlwidgets)
 + Purely Javascript, so easy to embed in web pages.

General comments
“On-plot” vs “off-plot” interactions
 * Cook and Swayne (2007) calls “direct manipulation” (“on-plot”). “Indirect manipulation” = “off-plot”. Indirect manipulation = queries made via drop down menu selection, tick boxes, sliders etc… (ie. via interactive widgets).
 * Shiny makes “off-plot” interactions easy (was there anything prior to Shiny?).
 * “Classical” interaction has been more focused on “on-plot” interactions (see tools described by Cook and Swayne).
 * Plotly allows for “on-plot” interactions, but limited in flexibility of linking different variables. Considerable delay for n>50000. 
 * Smooth “on-plot” interaction is hard to achieve.
 * cpsigvert book: 
  - Indirect manipulation useful when the ‘unit(s) of interest’ cannot be easily located on the graphical space. 
  - Powerful to use both indirect and direct manipulation if they are synced. 
  eg. Select city from drop down menu to highlight plot (indirect) AND click on plot to have city appear in selection box (direct). See https://cpsievert.github.io/plotly_book/linking-views-without-shiny.html#linking-views-without-shiny


* ggobi may set the benchmark of interactive techniques possible and help identify gaps.

* Tips
- Testing: Assign variable to interaction fn and print() the output.
