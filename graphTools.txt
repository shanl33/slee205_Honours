Strengths and Weaknesses of Graphics Tools
* Consider ease of learning, installing and coverage of desired techniques.  
See summaryTable.csv.

Shiny: http://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/latest/
 + Easy to learn and set up.
 + Aesthetically appealing output (publish-ready).
 - Limitation on interaction options (?) since only a limited number of input and output options.
 ? Doesn’t allow for low-level control, customisation
 ? Loading large data files onto the R server
 ? Brushing interaction possible (see link above)

R Base Graphics
 - Possible, but difficult to locate interaction (ie. click location).
 - Relatively slow at drawing graphics compared to a browser platform.

Plotly: https://plot.ly/r/reference/
 * ‘Interaction’ functions: plot_ly() or ggplotly().
 + Easy to use with ggplot2 (and automatically loads ggplot2).
   + With ggplot2 brings the flexibility of creating a wide range of plots.
 + Aesthetically appealing output (publish-ready).
 + Allows for collaboration in plot creation.
 + Can be used with Shiny.
 - When data points > 50 000 (eg. AQ delay data):
    - Delay in creating ‘zoom in’ selection of plot.
    - Difficulty keeping up with tooltip display.
 ? Tooltip default doesn’t seem to work for bar plot, even though it seems trivial (but works for scatterplot).
 + Allows for brushing (by lasso) and hence most likely linking.
 ? Can only ‘call up’ variables used in the aesthetics of the plot (?), but combined with Shiny might be able to select the vars to use in aesthetics as inputs.
 
Highcharts (via highchartr and htmlwidgets)
 + Purely Javascript, so easy to embed in web pages.
