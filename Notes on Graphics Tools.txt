Strengths and Weaknesses of Graphics Tools
* Consider easy of learning, installing and coverage of desired techniques (e.g. interactivity, large data sets).

Shiny: http://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/latest/
 + Easy to learn and set up.
 + Aesthetically appealing and user friendly interface.
 - Limitation on interaction options (?) since only a limited number of input and output options.
 ? Doesn’t allow for low-level control, customisation
 ? Loading large data files onto the R server
 ? Brushing interaction (see link above)

R Base Graphics
 - Possible, but difficult to locate interaction (ie. click location).
 - Relatively slow at drawing graphics compared to a browser platform.

Plotly: https://plot.ly/r/reference/
 * ‘Interaction’ functions: plot_ly() or ggplotly().
 + Easy to use with ggplot2 (and automatically loads ggplot2).
 + Can be used with Shiny.
 - When data points > 5000 (eg. AQ delay data):
    - Delay in updating image after zoom in selection on plot.
    - Difficulty keeping up with tooltip display.
 ? Tooltip default doesn’t seem to work for bar plot, even though it seems trivial (but works for scatterplot).
 
Highcharts
 + Purely Javascript, so easy to embed in web pages.

rCharts
 + Supports multiple javascript charting libraries, incl. Highchairs.
